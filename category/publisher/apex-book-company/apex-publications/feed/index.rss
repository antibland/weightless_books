<p>&#8220;Almost impossible stories filled with surprising warmth and strangeness by a studied craftsman of the imagination. Douglas Warrick&#8217;s <em>Plow the Bones</em> has provided dangerous tales of puppets with secrets, unforgettable rock bands, haunted closets and people who may or may not be human; perhaps they&#8217;re more than human. From transformative games with strangers to poor souls experiencing heaven and hell (and not quite sure which is which), you will never forget these unsettling stories.&#8221;<br />
—<b>Ann VanderMeer, Hugo Award-winning editor of <em>The New Weird</em></b></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been far too long since I&#8217;ve read a collection of horror stories that actually disturbed me. This one did. Like the bastard child of Chuck Palahniuk and Clive Barker, Doug Warrick writes feverishly, like a man on a charnel train that is relentlessly barreling its way through corrupt and ugly terrain, heading for some great, unknowable horror. Herein lies a gruesome gathering of Gothic nightmares fashioned from Warrick&#8217;s lyrical, affecting, mesmeric prose. One of the finest collections I&#8217;ve read in quite some time.&#8221;<br />
—<b>Kealan Patrick Burke, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of <em>The Turtle Boy</em>, <em>Kin</em>, and <em>Nemesis</em></b></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Plow the Bones</em> is hands-down the finest single-author collection I&#8217;ve read in a decade.&#8221;<br />
—<b>Gary A. Braunbeck, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of <em>In Silent Graves</em>, <em>Far Dark Fields</em>, and <em>To Each Their Darkness</em></b></p>

<div></div>
<div><strong>Reviews</strong></div>
<div>
<p>&#8220;Intellectually surreal and emotionally disturbing, <b>Douglas F. Warrick&#8217;s</b> collection of tales marks a superb introduction for readers to the <i>Apex Voices</i> line of fiction.&#8221;<br />
<em>&#8211;Beauty in Ruins, Bob Milne</em></p>
<p>&#8220;<em>Plow the Bones</em> is not a book to run through. The author has invested considerable effort in constructing some, at times, rather beautiful prose which rewards careful attention with the revelation of pleasing ideas. We flirt with surrealism and notice elements of the supernatural. Philosophical abstractions try to attract our attention as we lie alienated in different settings. There are occasional snatches of weird as if overheard accidentally in real settings. And overall there are symptoms of intelligence at work. As a collection, it’s a positive delight from start to finish!&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Opinionator, David Marshall</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if you like your fiction easy, simple and fun, then I will just tell you to stop now. You won’t like this stuff. His stories are dense and, at times, intensely painful. This is not good time reading. At the same time, it is damn good.&#8221;<br />
&#8211;Horrornews.net, Anton Cancre</p>
<p><strong>Douglas F. Warrick</strong> is a writer, a musician, and a world-traveler. His first published story appeared in Apex Science Fiction &amp; Horror Digest back in 2006. Since then, Douglas’s work has been published in a variety of periodicals, websites, podcasts, and anthologies, and has grown progressively stranger.</p>
<p>Douglas originally hails from Dayton, OH, but his travels have taken him all over Asia. Douglas has screamed Buzzcock’s lyrics with Korean punk rockers in the neon alleys of Seoul, marveled at the oddness of Beijing’s masked opera singers and illusionists, piloted a bicycle through Kyoto on the way to the Golden Temple, broken up a fight between an Australian tourist and a Thai street vendor in Bangkok, and learned that the world is much weirder and more wonderful than anything he could fabricate.</p>

Ecstasy is laughably inadequate, as are rapture, euphoria, bliss . . . . Ugly, harsh syllables that come nowhere near capturing the merest fraction of what he feels. The experience is primal and transcendent, like birth, like death.</em></p>
<p>Scott Raymond lost his parents in a bloodbath when he was only nine years old, but despite the occasional headaches and hallucinations, he&#8217;s managed to turn that trauma into moderate success as a true crime writer. The success doesn&#8217;t extend to keeping up the relationship with his estranged wife and son, however. Hoping to regain a sense of normal family life, he follows them to Ash Creek, Ohio, under the pretense of writing a new book about a missing six-year-old girl.</p>
<p>There, he encounters a young woman who shares the missing girl&#8217;s name. She leads Scott into a world of psychotropic spiders, shark-toothed teenagers and the expression of nearly every dark desire. Fear and fascination lay equal claim as the nightmare fantasies of this realm bleed into Scott&#8217;s daily life and his attempts to maintain a relationship with his son. </p>
<p>Soon, he will need to use this world of cruelty and pain to face his past, his future, and what his life might have become. If he fails, it is only a matter of time before the nightmare that bloodied his childhood will reach out to ensnare his own son.</p>

Living on the cutting edge of biomechanical science was supposed to allow her to lead a normal life in a near-perfect copy of her physical self while awaiting a cure for a rare and deadly genetic disorder.</p>
<p>But a bioandroid isn&#8217;t a real person. Not according to the protesters outside Celia&#8217;s house, her coworkers, or even her wife. Not according to her own evolving view of herself. As she begins to strip away the human affectations and inhibitions programmed into her new body, the chasm between the warm pains of flesh-and-blood life and the chilly comfort of the machine begins to deepen. Love, passion, reality, and memory war within Celia&#8217;s body until she must decide whether to betray old friends or new ones in the choice between human and machine.</p>
